# Vaccination_Record_Management_System
This project is aimed at developing a vaccine record management. It is a system meant to maintain all the details regarding Admin, Patient details which includes doctor details,vaccine details, bill details. We have developed it using Python and Mysql .It will also reduce the paperwork and hence reducing the manpower.
# Abstract
Immunization protects us from many harmful diseases that can have very serious complications or even cause death. More than 30 million children are unimmunized either
because vaccines are unavailable, because health services are poorly provided or inaccessible, or because families are uninformed or misinformed about when and why to bring
their children for immunization. The main purpose of this project is to develop a computerized system that will transform the vaccination booklet to an immunization information
system in a hospital. The project will automate the entire process of immunization at
the Health Centre by capturing all immunization details. Besides reducing paper work
and use of immunization booklet, the system will facilitate better record keeping and
enable quick access to immunization records. The system is simple and easy to use.
It has functionalities to facilitate registration of patients, scheduling of immunization,
searching and data retrieval and report generation. Observation and interviewing are
the two methods used for collecting data. Development tool is Python and the database
management system is MYSQL.

records required for certain jobs or school enrollment.
